				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Paragraph Styles</h3>
<p>When creating your post, you can style <a title="Post With Style Examples" href="http://themewich.com/struck_dummy/post-everything/">many elements</a> to get your point across. There is the standard <strong>strong tag</strong>, an <em>em tag</em> and a <del>strikethrough</del>. Maybe you want to declare some <abbr title="This is the abbreviation title.">Abbreviations</abbr> or add some inline <code>code examples</code>. Perhaps you have some <s>text that is no longer accurate</s>, or simply want to make an <q>inline quotation</q> or <cite>Quick Citation</cite>. Of course, it&#8217;s always nice to <mark>highlight something important</mark> if you need to. We can also style <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> so if you&#8217;re 2<sup>nd</sup> to Heisenberg you can create C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>0 in your spare time. You can even use older HTML4 tags like <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <big>big</big> or <small>small</small>. If you use the “kitchen sink” view you can also add <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline</span> styling and set <span style="color: #ff0000;">text color</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is a blockquote element complete with a citation!&#8221; <cite>&#8211; Andre Gagnon, Themewich</cite></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a left aligned paragraph. Pellentesque aliquet nibh nec urna. In nisi neque, aliquet vel, dapibus id, mattis vel. Sed egestas, ante et vulputate volutpat, eros pede semper est, vitae luctus metus libero eu augue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pellentesque aliquet nibh nec urna. In nisi neque, aliquet vel, dapibus id, mattis vel. Sed egestas, ante et vulputate volutpat, eros pede semper est, vitae luctus metus libero eu augue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is a center aligned paragraph. Pellentesque aliquet nibh nec urna. In nisi neque, aliquet vel, dapibus id, mattis vel. Sed egestas, ante et vulputate volutpat, eros pede semper est, vitae luctus metus libero eu augue.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">This is a right aligned paragraph. Pellentesque aliquet nibh nec urna. In nisi neque, aliquet vel, dapibus id, mattis vel. Sed egestas, ante et vulputate volutpat, eros pede semper est, vitae luctus metus libero eu augue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pellentesque aliquet nibh nec urna. In nisi neque, aliquet vel, dapibus id, mattis vel. Sed egestas, ante et vulputate volutpat, eros pede semper est, vitae luctus metus libero eu augue.</p>
